# ChessWhizz
ChessWhizz project is a strategy-quiz-networked game that is created in unity3d

ChessWhizz is a strategy-quiz game that uses the concept of the chess board game twisted with the quiz events triggered when a lower level piece is trying to attack a higher level opponent piece.
This is a multiplayer game that uses the UNet System of Unity3d Game Engine. It is a networked game but dont need to have an internet connection to play with other players. being in the same network or wifi connection is enough for the connection. just input the IP address of the host in the input field to join.
The game would end when one of the Kings are defeated.

Feel free to use it as a reference and comments and suggestions are welcome.
